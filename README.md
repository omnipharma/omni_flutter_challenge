# omni_flutter_challenge

Need to do a Trelloâ€™s style app, needing to have specific required parameters, including:


**Required features**
Create, edit and delete tasks.
Create, edit and delete columns for types of statuses (required 1 only initial column and irreplaceable and not deletable).
Cards and tasks can be moved between available statuses.
In each task user can be change owner, teams and description.

**App composition**
All application operations be communicated with local storage ecosystem, (e.g Hive or SharedPrefs).

Layout building need to be responsible for mobile and web (Chrome or another browser)

Application needs to run in web and mobile ways.

Persistent data.

Consistent architecture and choose a state management method for the project.

Clean Dart and SOLID principles.

README and all documentation explaining the app composition, with selected architecture, state management, how to run app with requirements and all technical decisions.

Would be nice if

Smooth, beautiful and clean animations.

Visual feedback for each action of user on modify tasks.

Unit and integration Flutter tests.
